        <h1>Hi there! I'm Ovi</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website. I am a Software Engineer based in Romania.</p>
        <p>I've been coding since 2005 and transitioned to remote work in 2020. Over the years, I've contributed to several SaaS companies spanning industries like social media, marketing, gaming, and entertainment.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am a Technical Lead at <a href="https://www.fabricdata.com/">Fabric</a>. Fabric is Hollywood's go to title management solution. Our customers manage catalogs of best-in-class TV shows, feature films and games, and enhance their programs with our data services.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I love traveling, tinkering with home automation, playing video games, and digging into books on history and economics.</p>
        <p>Feel free to reach out to me:</p>
